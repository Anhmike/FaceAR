 FaceAR

We scan the influencers for the causes to communicate with donors. So the donors can feel a real chat with the influencers. who are influencers? it could be identify the cause and popular. So that donors can feel the live present of the influencer. When the donar donate money, they can feel that are actually speak with real cause and real people who are acknowledge kindness and make donors their engagement to the cause more matter because we actually bring the almost live person to speak them in person. So the reality, the influencers to be in person in order make the cause. So by having FaceAR, we gave faces to social causes to the donars. So we know that sale in person is more in person than marketing campaign. What if can blend the marketing campaing with more augmented realistic in person, we may help to persuade more donors to commit the Estee Lauder Companies Brand and Social Good.
